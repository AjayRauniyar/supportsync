𝗦𝗔𝗣 𝗦𝘂𝗽𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗦𝘆𝗻𝗰

SAP SupportSync is an AI-driven, multi-agent support platform that reimagines how SAP enterprise support operates.  
It turns slow, reactive support into 𝗮 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲, 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗼𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝘀𝘂𝗽𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁 𝗲𝗰𝗼𝘀𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺 built on Gemini.

𝟭. 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺

Enterprise SAP support today is:

- Slow and reactive  
- Dependent on manual triage and routing  
- Fragmented across chat, tickets, emails, and meetings  
- Hard to scale for high-severity incidents and global customers

Customers wait, experts are overloaded, and valuable knowledge stays siloed.

𝟮. 𝗦𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 – 𝗦𝗔𝗣 𝗦𝘂𝗽𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗦𝘆𝗻𝗰

SAP SupportSync is a 𝗺𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗶-𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝘀𝘂𝗽𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁 𝘀𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺 powered by 𝗚𝗲𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗶.  
It behaves like a digital support manager that can:

- Understand customer issues in natural language  
- Match them to the best available experts  
- Spin up “swarm rooms” for collaborative incident resolution  
- Assist during meetings with summaries, action items, and redaction  
- Continuously learn from every resolved case

At a high level:

> 𝗖𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗿 → 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝘁𝗕𝗼𝘁 → 𝗘𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝘁 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 → 𝗦𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗺 𝗥𝗼𝗼𝗺 → 𝗔𝗜 𝗠𝗲𝗲𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗔𝘀𝘀𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝘁 → 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝘂𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 + 𝗞𝗻𝗼𝘄𝗹𝗲𝗱𝗴𝗲 𝗨𝗽𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗲

 𝟯. 𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 & 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝗽𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀

𝟯.𝟭 𝗖𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗿 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝘁𝗕𝗼𝘁 𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁
- First point of contact for customers  
- Collects context (product, severity, environment)  
- Resolves simple FAQs directly using knowledge base  
- Detects complex / high-severity cases and triggers escalation

𝟯.𝟮 𝗘𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝘁 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁
- Selects the best expert (or experts) using:
  - Product expertise
  - Current workload / availability
  - Past success with similar tickets
  - Semantic similarity to past incidents
- Outputs a ranked list of experts and routing decision

𝟯.𝟯 𝗦𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗺 𝗥𝗼𝗼𝗺 𝗢𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗼𝗿 𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁
- Creates a 𝘚𝘸𝘢𝘳𝘮 𝘙𝘰𝘰𝘮 for complex incidents  
- Coordinates:
  - Room creation / meeting link
  - Expert invitations
  - Scheduling and reminders
- Removes manual coordination overhead

𝟯.𝟰 𝗔𝗜 𝗠𝗲𝗲𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗔𝘀𝘀𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝘁 𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁
- Joins the swarm meeting virtually (via transcript)  
- Provides:
  - Pre-brief summary for experts
  - Live notes and key timestamps
  - Action items & follow-ups
  - Redaction for sensitive data (info-down mode)

𝟯.𝟱 𝗞𝗻𝗼𝘄𝗹𝗲𝗱𝗴𝗲 𝗥𝗲𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘃𝗮𝗹 & 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁
- Retrieves past cases, KB articles, and similar incidents  
- After each resolution:
  - Generates structured post-incident documentation
  - Updates knowledge base
  - Improves ChatBot answers and expert matching embeddings

𝟰. 𝗖𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗔𝗜 / 𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗽𝘁𝘀 𝗨𝘀𝗲𝗱 (𝗖𝗼𝘂𝗿𝘀𝗲-𝗦𝗽𝗲𝗰𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗰)

The project applies **at least three key concepts** from the course:

1. 𝗠𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗶-𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗢𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻
   - Separate agents for chat, routing, orchestration, meeting assistance, and knowledge.  
   - A central orchestrator coordinates which agent runs when, based on ticket state.

2. 𝗧𝗼𝗼𝗹 𝗨𝘀𝗲 & 𝗥𝘂𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲 𝗔𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 
   - Agents call tools for:
     - KB retrieval  
     - Swarm room creation (meeting link tool – mocked)  
     - Transcript storage and retrieval  
     - Expert directory lookup

3. 𝗥𝗲𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘃𝗮𝗹-𝗔𝘂𝗴𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗚𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 (𝗥𝗔𝗚)  
   - ChatBot and Meeting Assistant both call a retrieval tool to ground responses in prior tickets / docs.

4. 𝗣𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 & 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗸𝗳𝗹𝗼𝘄 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻
   - Swarm Room Orchestrator plans the sequence:
     > gather context → pick experts → schedule meeting → brief experts → log outcome

5. Memory / Learning Loop
   - After resolution, the Learning Agent writes back structured summaries so future tickets are answered faster.

𝟱. 𝗦𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺 𝗔𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲

𝗙𝗿𝗼𝗻𝘁-𝗲𝗻𝗱: Next.js (TypeScript)  
𝗕𝗮𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗻𝗱 / 𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀: Node.js + Gemini API  
𝗥𝘂𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲: Next.js API routes (can be deployed to Vercel / Cloud Run)  

𝘏𝘪𝘨𝘩-𝘭𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘭 𝘧𝘭𝘰𝘸:

1. Customer opens the web UI and describes their issue.  
2. Frontend calls `/api/support` with conversation + metadata.  
3. Backend orchestrator:
   - Runs 𝗖𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗿𝗖𝗵𝗮𝘁𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻t → yields structured ticket.  
   - If complex: runs 𝗘𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝘁𝗠𝗮𝘁𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁 + 𝗦𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗺𝗥𝗼𝗼𝗺𝗢𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗼𝗿.  
   - Optionally spawns 𝗠𝗲𝗲𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴𝗔𝘀𝘀𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝘁𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁 and 𝗞𝗻𝗼𝘄𝗹𝗲𝗱𝗴𝗲𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁.  
4. Response is sent back to the UI:
   - Initial answer / clarification questions  
   - Chosen expert(s) and swarm room link (mocked demo)  
   - Status of ticket and actions taken.
